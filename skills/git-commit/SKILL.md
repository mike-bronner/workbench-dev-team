# Git Commit Messages

## Format

```
<type>: <emoji> <description>.

<optional body>

<optional footer(s)>
```

The colon, emoji, and description each separated by exactly one space: `type: emoji description.`

## Rules

1. Description starts with the appropriate gitmoji, one space after `:`
2. Description ends with a period
3. No scopes — ever
4. Only reference real GitHub issues in footers
5. Always consult `references/gitmoji.md` to select the correct emoji for the change
6. Always consult `references/conventional-commits.md` to determine the correct type and overall format for the commit message, based on SemVer mapping and breaking change syntax
